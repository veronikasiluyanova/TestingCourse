Make that money, fake that bunny, ache my tummy
On the fence, all the time
Paint young honey, face so sunny, ain't that funny
All my friends always lie to me
I know they're thinking

Keep on dreaming, don't stop giving, fight those demons
Sell your soul, not your whole self
If they see you when you're sleeping, make them leave it
And I can't even see if it's all there anymore so
